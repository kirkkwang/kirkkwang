### Hey there, I'm Kirk!

I'm from San Diego, CA and I'm currently studying how to be a full stack developer at Notch8. I have an extreme interest in digital repositories and open data. I got started with coding with some good old fashioned Windows batch scripts and the idea of automation blew my mind. Since then I moved on to working with Python and then attended at LEARN Academy and formally learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL.
